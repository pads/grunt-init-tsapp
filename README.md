# grunt-init-tsapp

A grunt init template for creating [TiddlySpace](http://tiddlyspace.com) apps.

The idea behind this was is to reduce repetition when creating apps on TiddlySpace and encourage
developers to take advantage of the many useful grunt tasks that aid with web development workflow.

It provides [tsapp](https://github.com/cdent/tsapp.git) boilerplate and a Grunt file with some useful tasks.

If this template is too opinionated then just use tsapp by itself.

This is very much work in progress.

## Prerequisites

* [grunt](http://gruntjs.com): `npm install -g grunt-cli grunt-init`
* [tsapp](https://github.com/cdent/tsapp.git)

## Installation

`git clone git@github.com:gruntjs/grunt-init-tsapp.git ~/.grunt-init/tsapp`

Then run: `grunt-init tsapp` from your project root.

After completing the wizard, run `npm install` to fetch the initial project dependencies.
It creates the folder structure within your project as defined in the root folder of this one.

Run `grunt --help` to see what you can do now.
